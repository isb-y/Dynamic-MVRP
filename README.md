# Dynamic-MVRP
Dynamic MVRP
This solves a dynamic multiple vehicle routing problem (DM-VRP), which I generated during my master thesis in the context of multi robot task allocation (MRTA). 
The main file solves an inital MVRP Problem, the data is in the folder with corresponding coordinates. It tries to minimize the maximal route of all routes. 
A heuristic approach is taken to solve the MILP as a combinatorial optimization problem, such as 2-opt to name one.
